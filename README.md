# My Portfolio
My portfolio website showcasing my development work. This site is made without any frameworks or external libraries - Everything done by hand!

# Run
Use whatever local server you prefer. 
I find live-server to be easy and simple - And it has live-reloading out of the box.
`npm install -g live-server`
`live-server`
